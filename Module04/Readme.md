# Module 04 - Live Session


- [x] Can we practice nested ForLoops? I am having difficulty understanding/visualizing the complex code - each iteration and counting the number of operations at the end of each iteration.

- [ ] Discussion and practicing examples when we use switch statements without the break statement.

- [ ] Creating command line prompts ./file.c name ID course_name campus . Can we create some basic scanf file that we can use to fill some data, such as the following and print the same in specific toString type format.
  * name of student
  * student ID
  * courses registered
  * campus
